# ACM Digital Library Data Scraper

This Python script scrapes publication data from the ACM Digital Library, including titles, URLs, badges, abstracts, conference names, and published dates, and saves the extracted information into an Excel file.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes `requests` to fetch web pages and `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML content.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts titles, URLs, badges, abstracts, conference names, and published dates from each publication.
- **Excel Output**: Saves the extracted data into an Excel file for easy viewing and analysis.
- **Pagination Handling**: Iterates through multiple pages of search results to ensure comprehensive data collection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `openpyxl`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 openpyxl
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/acm-scraper.git
   cd acm-scraper
   ```

2. **Edit the base URL (optional)**:
   - The script is configured to scrape publications from a specific ACM concept. If you want to scrape different data, update the `base_url` variable in the script with the appropriate search URL.

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python acm_scraper.py
   ```

4. **View the output**:
   - The scraped data will be saved in an Excel file named `acm_extracted_data.xlsx` in the same directory as the script.

## Directory Structure

- `acm_scraper.py`: The main script that performs the web scraping and data extraction.
- `acm_extracted_data.xlsx`: The Excel file where the extracted data is stored.

## Example Output

| Title                                   | URL                            | Badges                   | Abstract                         | Conference                | Published  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Example Title                           | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145 | Open Access; Full Paper  | This is an example abstract...   | ACM Conference on Example  | 2024-01-01 |

## Notes

- **Rate Limiting**: The script includes delays between requests to avoid overwhelming the server. Adjust the `time.sleep()` intervals if you encounter issues with rate limits.
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensure the target pages on the ACM Digital Library haven't changed in structure, as this could affect data extraction accuracy.
